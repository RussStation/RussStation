changes: 
  - balance: "Fire Locks now check for atmos issues on their own, rather than leaving it to the Fire Alarm. This should cut down on a single breach turning the main halls into a navigational mess."
  - balance: "Fire Locks will wait five seconds after a reset before triggering again.
tweak: Fire Alarms will still activate all Fire Locks in an area if manually pulled.
tweak: Fire Alarms are still used to reset Fire Locks, but now it's a right-click action.
tweak: Emagging a Fire Alarm will apply the effect to all Fire Locks in its area, behaving roughly the same as before.
tweak: Disabling Fire Detect is also still done at the Fire Alarm and should work closely as it used to."
  - balance: "Right-clicking a closed Fire Lock with a crowbar will open it for exactly two seconds. Holding it open (left click) is unchanged."
  - balance: "Firelock emag functions (ignoring atmos detect) is now done by a doorjack on the firelock itself. You can still emag a fire alarm to mute it, though.
sprite: Fire Locks now have lights that display the reason they are active. Orange is Hot, Cyan means Cold, and White means a Fire Alarm was pulled."
