SIF (Sprites and ideas by MetalGearMan)

Sif spawns randomly in lavaland when it can, in the form of a sword which the user needs to interact with in order to summon Sif.

Speical attacks:
	- When Sif's able to he will charge his current target with 200% increased speed for 1 second, getting right next to his target.
	- Sif can also do an AOE spin attack.

Sif has three stages:
 1. Normal state when it has health above 50%.
 2. When Sif reaches below 50% health it enters a angered state, which makes Sif's movement speed faster and attack speed slower,
 	with increased usage of specials.
 3. At 20% health Sif is significantly slowed but constantly doing special attacks.

WHEN SIF IS ANGERED (Stage 2):
	- Sif's specials take 50% less time to recharge from (Normal = 100) to (Angered = 50)
	- Sif's attack speed decreased by 30% and movement speed increased by 50%

WHEN SIF IS ENRAGED (Stage 3):
	- Sif's specials take 60% less time to recharge from (Angered = 50) to (Enraged = 30)
	- Sif is way slower but does more damage, as well as chances to dodge projectiles and melee attacks more often.

When Sif dies, it leaves behind a:
	!! Sword Of The Forsaken !! -> Giant ass sword that does damage. Small chance of blocking hits and almost no chance to block projectiles.
	!! Necklace Of The Forsaken !! -> Works by instantly reviving or fully healing the user at their discretion (one time use and can be used when dead, knocked out or alive)
	!! Dark Energy !! (If killed with a kinetic crusher) -> A Kinetic Crusher attachment which performs a bash attack for 100 damage (only works on big boy mobs like megafaunas)
Difficulty: Medium
